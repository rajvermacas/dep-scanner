I want to add below functionality:                     
    1. Right now there are two ways to check the           
    dependencies.                                          
        a. api calls                                           
        b. dependency scan                                     
                                                           
    2. In both these approaches we need to find out internal source and external source for api calls and dependencies
    3. my company name is starc. Whenever there is this keyword starc in the dependency name or api call then mark it as internal source otherwise external source
    4. Make this company name parameter configurable from env variable.
    5. in src/dependency_scanner_tool/reporters/templates/report.html the fullfullScanData object should contain the source information internal/external against each dependency/api call
