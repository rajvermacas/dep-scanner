- **Stage 3**: ✅ COMPLETED (January 18, 2025) - Performance & Features
- **Stage 4**: Ready to Begin (Production Readiness)

### API Endpoints Status
- **Core Endpoints**: `/health`, `/scan`, `/jobs/{job_id}`, `/jobs/{job_id}/results` ✅
- **New Stage 3 Endpoints**: 
  - `GET /jobs` (pagination, filtering, sorting) ✅
  - `GET /jobs/{job_id}/partial` (real-time progress) ✅
- **Authentication**: HTTP Basic Auth on all endpoints ✅
- **Security**: All Stage 2 protections active ✅

### Performance Features Status
- **Concurrent Jobs**: 5 simultaneous scans supported ✅
- **Repository Cache**: LRU cache with TTL (24h default) ✅
- **Job Lifecycle**: Automatic timeout and cleanup ✅
- **Memory Management**: Bounded cache size and resource cleanup ✅

## Important Context

### Stage 3 Features Implemented

#### 1. Concurrent Job Management
- **Configuration**: `JobLifecycleManager(max_concurrent_jobs=5)`
- **Thread Safety**: All operations use proper locking mechanisms
- **Resource Tracking**: Automatic cleanup of job resources
- **Timeout Protection**: Configurable job timeouts (30 minutes default)

#### 2. Job History Endpoint
- **Endpoint**: `GET /jobs?page=1&per_page=10&status=completed`
- **Pagination**: Supports page/per_page parameters with limits
- **Filtering**: Status-based filtering (pending, running, completed, failed)
- **Sorting**: Newest jobs first (by created_at descending)

#### 3. Partial Results Streaming
- **Endpoint**: `GET /jobs/{job_id}/partial`
- **Real-time Updates**: Progress percentage and scanning status
- **Data Structure**: Structured partial results with file counts and dependencies
- **Availability**: Only for running jobs

#### 4. Repository Caching
- **Implementation**: `RepositoryCache` with LRU eviction
- **Cache Size**: Configurable max_size (default: 10 repositories)
- **TTL**: 24-hour default with configurable expiration
- **Thread Safety**: All cache operations are thread-safe

### Technical Implementation Details

#### New Files Created
- `src/dependency_scanner_tool/api/repository_cache.py` - LRU cache implementation
- `tests/test_api/test_concurrent_jobs.py` - Concurrent job management tests
- `tests/test_api/test_job_history.py` - Job history endpoint tests
- `tests/test_api/test_partial_results.py` - Partial results streaming tests
- `tests/test_api/test_repository_cache.py` - Repository cache tests

#### Modified Files
- `src/dependency_scanner_tool/api/models.py` - Added new response models
- `src/dependency_scanner_tool/api/app.py` - Added new endpoints
- `src/dependency_scanner_tool/api/job_manager.py` - Added partial results support
- `src/dependency_scanner_tool/api/git_service.py` - Integrated repository caching

#### Key Data Models
```python
class JobHistoryResponse(BaseModel):
    jobs: list[JobSummary]
    total: int
    page: int
    per_page: int
    total_pages: int

class PartialResultsResponse(BaseModel):
    job_id: str
    status: JobStatus
    progress: int
    partial_results: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
    last_updated: Optional[str]
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (None Required)
The implementation is **production-ready** with no blocking issues. All Stage 3 requirements have been met with excellent code quality.

### Stage 4 Planning (When Ready)
Stage 4 focuses on Production Readiness with the following planned features:
1. **Comprehensive Monitoring** - Metrics endpoint and detailed logging
2. **API Versioning** - Versioned endpoints (/api/v1/)
3. **Advanced Authentication** - Multiple API keys support
4. **Webhook Notifications** - Real-time job completion notifications

### Development Commands
```bash
# Test all API endpoints
python -m pytest tests/test_api/ -v

# Run new Stage 3 tests specifically
python -m pytest tests/test_api/test_concurrent_jobs.py -v
python -m pytest tests/test_api/test_job_history.py -v
