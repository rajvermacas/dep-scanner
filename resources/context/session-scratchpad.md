## Current State

### Development Plan Status
- **Stage 1**: ✅ COMPLETED (January 18, 2025)
- **Stage 2**: ✅ COMPLETED (January 18, 2025) - Security & Robustness
- **Stage 3**: Ready to Begin (Performance & Features)
- **Stage 4**: Planned (Production Readiness)

### Code Quality Status
- **All API Tests**: 42/42 passing ✅
- **Security Tests**: 24/24 passing ✅
- **Code Review**: ✅ APPROVED for production
- **Authentication**: Fully functional and tested
- **Documentation**: Complete security guide available

### Repository State
- **Branch**: feature/rest-server
- **Status**: Production-ready with comprehensive test coverage
- **Files Modified**: 3 test files updated with proper authentication
- **Test Coverage**: 100% API endpoint coverage
- **Dependencies**: All security dependencies properly configured

## Technical Details

### Test Authentication Pattern
```python
@pytest.fixture
def auth_headers():
    """Create valid authentication headers."""
    credentials = base64.b64encode(b"test_user_secure:test_password_secure_123!").decode("utf-8")
    return {"Authorization": f"Basic {credentials}"}
```

### Fixed Test Files
- `tests/test_api/test_job_status.py` - Added authentication headers to all test functions
- `tests/test_api/test_results.py` - Added authentication headers to all test functions  
- `tests/test_api/test_integration.py` - Fixed mocking strategy and added authentication

### Integration Test Mocking Strategy
```python
# Fixed mocking approach for GitPython-based implementation
with patch('dependency_scanner_tool.api.git_service.git_service.clone_repository') as mock_clone_repo, \
     patch('dependency_scanner_tool.api.git_service.git_service.validate_repository') as mock_validate_repo:
    mock_clone_repo.return_value = Path('/tmp/test_repo')
    mock_validate_repo.return_value = True
```

## Important Context

### Stage 2 Security Implementation (COMPLETED)
- **Critical Security Fixes**: All 6 identified vulnerabilities completely resolved
- **HTTP Basic Authentication**: Environment-based credentials with no hardcoded defaults
- **Git URL Injection Prevention**: Comprehensive pattern blocking and validation
- **SSRF Vulnerability Prevention**: Private network and metadata endpoint protection
- **Domain Whitelist**: Enabled by default with trusted Git hosting domains
- **Resource Management**: Complete job lifecycle with automatic cleanup
- **Timeout Protection**: Git operations and job lifecycle timeout mechanisms

### Security Test Results
- **Total Tests**: 24 security tests
- **Passing**: 24/24 (100% success rate)
- **Test Categories**: Authentication (10), Injection Prevention (3), SSRF Protection (3), Resource Management (4), Timeout Protection (3), Domain Whitelist (1)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (None Required)
The implementation is **production-ready** with no blocking issues. All tests are passing and code review has been approved.

### Stage 3 Preparation (When Ready)
Stage 3 focuses on Performance & Features with the following planned implementations:
1. **Concurrent Job Management** - Support 5+ concurrent scan operations
2. **Job History Endpoint** - GET /jobs with pagination support
3. **Partial Results Streaming** - Real-time progress updates during scanning
4. **Repository Caching** - LRU cache for recently scanned repositories

### Development Commands
```bash
# Test all API endpoints
python -m pytest tests/test_api/ -v

# Run security tests specifically
python -m pytest tests/test_api/test_security.py -v

# Start development server
python -m dependency_scanner_tool.api.main

# Code quality checks
python -m ruff check src/dependency_scanner_tool/api/
```
