- **Task 3**: Quality Assurance - Verified 71 infrastructure tests passing (1 skipped as designed)
- **Task 4**: Code Review Process - Confirmed existing ✅ APPROVED status with 5/5 exemplary rating
- **Task 5**: Development Plan Update - Verified current progress tracking is accurate
- **Task 6**: Session Persistence - Saving current state (in progress)
- **Task 7**: Repository Maintenance - Pending .gitignore updates
- **Task 8**: Version Control - Pending final commit

### Comprehensive Quality Verification
- **Test Coverage**: All 71 infrastructure tests passing (1 properly skipped)
  - Kubernetes Scanner: 13 comprehensive tests

```

### Stage 2 Capabilities Verified
- **Kubernetes Scanner**: Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Ingress, PVC, multi-document YAML
- **Cloud SDK Detector**: Python/Java/JavaScript source code, requirements.txt, package.json, pom.xml
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for invalid files, proper logging
- **Performance**: Optimized for typical infrastructure codebases
- **Integration**: Seamless plugin architecture maintained

## Important Context

### Stage 2 Requirements Fulfilled - VERIFIED
Based on PRD and development plan requirements:
1. ✅ Kubernetes manifest detection and parsing - All major K8s resource types supported
2. ✅ Cloud SDK usage detection - AWS, Azure, GCP across Python/Java/JavaScript
3. ✅ Cloud provider categorization system - Proper service classification
4. ✅ Extended infrastructure classification rules - Allow/restrict capability
5. ✅ Integration with existing infrastructure - Seamless plugin architecture

### Session Validation Results
- **Quality Assurance**: 71 infrastructure tests passing, 1 properly skipped
- **Code Review**: Already ✅ APPROVED with exemplary 5/5 rating
- **Development Plan**: Already updated with completion status
- **Architecture**: Plugin system maintained with proper extensibility

## Next Steps Priority

### Immediate Session Completion (Tasks 7-8)
1. **Repository Maintenance**: Update .gitignore for build artifacts and IDE configs
2. **Version Control**: Create meaningful commit documenting session validation completion

### Future Development (Stage 3+)
1. **Stage 3**: CI/CD Pipeline Detection (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
2. **Reporter Updates**: Include infrastructure components in JSON/HTML output
3. **Performance**: Optimize for large enterprise infrastructure codebases
4. **Additional Scanners**: Databases, messaging systems, monitoring tools

## Technical Commands Reference
