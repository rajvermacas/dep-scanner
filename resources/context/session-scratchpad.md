- **Task 6**: Development Plan Update - Updated progress tracking to reflect Stage 3 completion
- **Task 7**: Session Persistence - Saving current state (in progress)
- **Task 8**: Repository Maintenance and Version Control - Pending

### Stage 3 CI/CD Scanner Implementation (Complete)
1. **Jenkins Scanner** (`jenkins.py`)
   - Supports both declarative and scripted pipeline syntax
   - Parses stages, tools, environment variables, and agent configurations
   - Comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation
   - 14 unit tests covering all scenarios

2. **GitHub Actions Scanner** (`github_actions.py`)
   - Full workflow YAML parsing with job, step, and action detection
   - Handles GitHub-specific YAML parsing quirks (on: vs True key issue)
   - Extracts triggers, environment variables, and dependencies
   - 12 unit tests with edge case coverage

3. **GitLab CI Scanner** (`gitlab_ci.py`)
   - Complete pipeline configuration analysis
   - Supports stages, jobs, variables, services, cache, and include directives
   - Proper separation of global vs job-specific configuration
   - 13 unit tests with comprehensive coverage

4. **Integration and Registry** (`manager.py`)
   - Successfully registered all three scanners in InfrastructureScannerManager
   - Maintains seamless plugin architecture compatibility
   - 7 integration tests validating end-to-end functionality

## Current State

### Development Progress
- **Stage 1**: ✅ COMPLETED (Terraform and Docker scanning)
- **Stage 2**: ✅ COMPLETED (Kubernetes and Cloud SDK Detection)
- **Stage 3**: ✅ COMPLETED (CI/CD Pipeline Detection) - **NEWLY COMPLETED**
- **Overall Progress**: 3/7 stages completed (42.9%)
- **Code Quality**: Exemplary - 5/5 senior review rating
- **Branch**: `feature/rest-api-scanner` (ready for final repository maintenance)

### Stage 3 Capabilities Implemented
- **Jenkins Pipeline Scanning**: Declarative and scripted pipelines, tools, environment variables, stages
- **GitHub Actions Workflow Scanning**: Complete workflow analysis, jobs, steps, actions, triggers, secrets
- **GitLab CI Pipeline Scanning**: Stages, jobs, variables, services, cache, includes, images
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for invalid files, proper logging, comprehensive edge cases
- **Performance**: Optimized for large projects - <10 seconds for complex CI/CD configurations
- **Integration**: Seamless plugin architecture maintained, proper registry management

## Important Context

### Stage 3 Requirements Fulfilled - VERIFIED
Based on PRD and development plan requirements:
1. ✅ Jenkins pipeline scanning (Jenkinsfile parsing) - Both declarative and scripted support
2. ✅ GitHub Actions workflow scanning - Complete YAML parsing with action detection
3. ✅ GitLab CI/CD configuration scanning - Full pipeline configuration analysis
4. ✅ CI/CD dependency classification system - Allow/restrict capability maintained
5. ✅ Integration with existing infrastructure - Seamless plugin architecture preserved

### Session Workflow Validation Results
- **Quality Assurance**: All 46 Stage 3 tests passing, infrastructure regression tests passing (71 passed, 1 skipped)
- **Code Review**: ✅ APPROVED with exemplary 5/5 rating - production ready
- **Development Plan**: Updated with Stage 3 completion status and progress tracking
- **Architecture**: Plugin system maintained with proper extensibility for future stages

## Next Steps Priority

### Immediate Session Completion (Tasks 7-8)
1. **Repository Maintenance**: Update .gitignore for build artifacts and IDE configs
2. **Version Control**: Create meaningful commit documenting Stage 3 completion

### Future Development (Stage 4+)
1. **Stage 4**: Database and Messaging Detection (PostgreSQL, MySQL, RabbitMQ, Kafka)
2. **Reporter Updates**: Include CI/CD components in JSON/HTML output
