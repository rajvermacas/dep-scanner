# REST Server API - Agile MVP-First Development Plan

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 18, 2025  
**Project:** Dependency Scanner Tool REST Server  
**Status:** Ready for Review  

---

## Executive Summary

This development plan outlines a 4-stage agile approach to implement a REST API server for the existing Dependency Scanner Tool. Following MVP-first principles, Stage 1 delivers a minimal working API that accepts Git repository URLs and returns dependency analysis results within 2-3 weeks. Subsequent stages iteratively enhance the API based on user feedback, adding authentication, performance optimizations, and advanced features.

The plan maximizes reuse of the existing DependencyScanner codebase, which already provides comprehensive dependency analysis across multiple languages (Python, Java, Scala). By wrapping the existing CLI functionality with FastAPI, we can deliver immediate value to microservice consumers while maintaining backward compatibility and minimizing technical risk.

Each stage produces deployable software with measurable outcomes, enabling rapid feedback cycles and continuous improvement. The MVP focuses solely on the core use case: enabling other microservices to programmatically scan repositories and receive category-based dependency classifications.

## Existing Application Analysis

### Current State
The Dependency Scanner Tool is a mature Python CLI application with:

**Core Capabilities:**
- Multi-language dependency scanning (Python, Java, Scala)
- Plugin-based parser architecture for extensibility
- Import analysis from source code
- API call detection and categorization
- Configurable dependency classification (allowed/restricted)
- Multiple output formats (JSON, HTML, text)
- Comprehensive test coverage

**Architecture Strengths:**
- Well-structured modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Registry-based plugin system for parsers and analyzers
- Robust error handling and logging
- Configuration via YAML files
- Established data models (Dependency, ScanResult, ApiCall)

**Technology Stack:**
- Python 3.8+ with type hints
- Click for CLI interface
- PyYAML for configuration
- Jinja2 for HTML reporting
- Comprehensive test suite with pytest

### Gap Analysis

**What Exists (Can Leverage):**
- Complete dependency scanning logic in `DependencyScanner` class
- All language parsers and analyzers
- Configuration system with category definitions
- JSON/HTML report generation
- Error handling infrastructure
- Test utilities and fixtures

**What Needs to Be Built:**
- REST API endpoints using FastAPI
- HTTP Basic Authentication middleware
- Git repository cloning functionality
- Background task processing for async operations
- Job management system with status tracking
- Response transformation to category-based format
- Temporary directory management for cloned repos
- API-specific error responses

---

## MVP Definition & Rationale

### Core Problem
Other microservices need programmatic access to dependency scanning capabilities without local filesystem access or CLI integration complexity.

### Essential Features for MVP
1. **Single Scan Endpoint**: POST /scan accepting Git repository URL
2. **Job Status Endpoint**: GET /jobs/{job_id} for async status checking
3. **Results Endpoint**: GET /jobs/{job_id}/results returning category-based analysis
4. **Health Check**: GET /health for basic monitoring
5. **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error messages

### Success Metrics
- API responds to scan requests within 5 seconds
- Successfully scans public Git repositories
- Returns accurate category-based dependency analysis
- Handles invalid URLs gracefully
- Achieves 95%+ uptime when deployed

### User Persona
**Primary**: Backend developers integrating dependency analysis into their microservices
**Secondary**: DevOps engineers monitoring service health

### MVP Exclusions
- Authentication (added in Stage 2)
- Performance optimizations
- Advanced error recovery
- Repository caching
- Concurrent job limits
- Private repository support

---

## Technology Stack Overview

### MVP Stack (Minimal)
- **Framework**: FastAPI (async support, automatic OpenAPI docs)
- **Server**: Uvicorn (production ASGI server)
- **Git Operations**: subprocess calls to system git
- **Job Storage**: In-memory dictionary (no persistence)
- **Configuration**: Existing config.yaml

### Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- **Authentication**: HTTP Basic Auth (Stage 2)
- **Git Library**: GitPython for better control (Stage 3)
- **Caching**: Redis for job persistence (Stage 4)
- **Monitoring**: OpenTelemetry integration (Stage 4)

## Code Reuse and Integration Strategy

### Maximum Reuse Approach

**Direct Reuse (No Modifications)**:
- `DependencyScanner` class - core scanning logic
- All parsers in `parsers/` directory
- All analyzers in `analyzers/` directory
- `DependencyClassifier` for classification
- Configuration loading from `config.yaml`
- Data models (Dependency, ScanResult)

**Wrapper Pattern**:
```python
# Pseudo-code example
class ScannerService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.scanner = DependencyScanner(...)  # Existing scanner
        
    async def scan_repository(self, git_url: str) -> str:
        # Clone repo to temp directory
        repo_path = await self.clone_repository(git_url)
        
        # Use existing scanner
        result = self.scanner.scan_project(repo_path)
        
        # Transform to API format
        return self.transform_result(result)
```

**New Components (Minimal)**:
- FastAPI application setup
- API models (request/response)
- Git operations wrapper
- Job management
- Result transformation

### Integration Points

1. **Configuration**: Read existing config.yaml
2. **Scanning**: Call scanner.scan_project()
3. **Results**: Transform ScanResult to API format
4. **Logging**: Extend existing logging setup
