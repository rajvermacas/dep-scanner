**Timeline**: 14 weeks total (2 weeks per stage)
**Approach**: Test-Driven Development with continuous user feedback integration

## Development Progress Status

**Current Status**: Stage 7 ✅ COMPLETED (July 6, 2025)
**Next Stage**: All stages completed - Production ready
**Overall Progress**: 7/7 stages completed (100%)

## Existing Application Analysis

### Current State Assessment

**Strengths to Leverage:**
- ✅ **Mature Plugin Architecture**: Registry-based system easily extensible for new scanner types
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: 186 test functions with TDD approach, ready for infrastructure tests
- ✅ **Robust Error Handling**: Well-structured exception hierarchy for new scanner types
- ✅ **Flexible Reporting**: JSON/HTML reporters with Jinja2 templates, expandable for infrastructure data
